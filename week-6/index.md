# Week 6: Coding and English Part 2

## About

In the Coding and English sessions, you will learn about how the teaching of Coding can be linked with the teaching of English, through the creation of digital stories in Scratch.

This session’s activities have been adapted from Unit 3 (Stories) of the Creative Computing Curriculum guide. The activities in Unit 3 are intended to encourage discussions about authorship, re-using materials and remixing projects in Scratch.

In the Part 2 session, we will focus on three activities from Unit 3 of the Creative Computing Curriculum guide: *Debug It!*, *Creature Construction* and *Pass It On*. 
You will also learn about some other resources for the teaching of Coding alongside English and Languages.

| Creative and Creative Thinking Capability Element                       | How this Element is addressed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Inquiring – identifying, exploring and organising information and ideas | In this session, you will create digital stories in Scratch after a process of inquiry. For example, in the *Pass It On* activity you may plan the story and get ideas from similar projects before creating your own Scratch program.                                                                                                      |
| Generating ideas, possibilities and actions                             | In this session, you will be encouraged to be creative in the activities and to explore a variety of ideas, possibilities and actions when creating your digital stories in Scratch.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Reflecting on thinking and processes                                    | In this session, you will be encouraged to reflect on how you completed the activity through the reflection prompts from the Creative Computing Curriculum guide. For example, in the *Pass It On* activity there are questions for encouraging reflection about building on other’s work and your feelings about having your work remixed. |
| Analysing, synthesising and evaluating reasoning and procedures         | In this session, you will have the opportunity to analyse, synthesis and evaluate your own reasoning and procedures. For example, in the *Pass It On* activity you will be able to plan out the different parts of the story you create and will be able to reflect on how this planning helped you code the story in Scratch.              |

| **ACTDIP019:** Design, modify and follow simple algorithms involving sequences of steps, branching, and iteration (repetition)                               | In this session’s activities, you will design, modify and follow algorithms (steps of instructions for a computer to follow).                                                                                                                        |
| **ACTDIP020:** Implement digital solutions as simple visual programs involving branching, iteration (repetition), and user input                             | In this session, you will implement a program in Scratch, a visual programming language, that includes loops (iteration), branching, events and user input.                                                                                          |
| **ACTDIP022:** Plan, create and communicate ideas and information, including collaboratively online, applying agreed ethical, social and technical protocols | In this session, you will collaborate with other participants in the session to create a digital story in Scratch. You will also learn about some of the potential ethical issues when co-authoring a digital story and strategies to address these. |
