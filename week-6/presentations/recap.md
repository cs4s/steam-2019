# Last Session

- Started activities in Unit 3 (Stories) of the Creative Computing Curriculum guide
- Focus is on the creation of Digital Stories
- We'll review some of the new blocks that we introduced as well
- This session's activities will involve less demonstration and more exploring than last week

---

# Digital Storytelling

- The use of computers to create and share stories
- Could use a variety of software (e.g. Powerpoint and iMovie)
- *Multimodal Texts:* combining images, audio, text and video
- Scratch can do all of that - and you can learn Coding at the same time as making these texts!

# Unit 3's Big Idea

- "Building on other people’s work has been a longstanding practice in programming, and has only been amplified by network technologies that provide access to a wide range of other people’s work."

- "An important goal of creative computing is to support connections between learners through *reusing* and *remixing*."

# Unit 3: Stories Part 1

- Three activities from the Guide:
    - *Conversations*
    - *Characters*
    - *Scenes*
- **Computational Concepts:** *Sequences*, *Events* and *Parallelism*

---

# New Blocks in Scratch

- *Broadcasting* (sending messages between Sprites)
- *Custom Blocks* (defining our own blocks)
- *Switch Backdrop* (changing what the *Stage* looks like)

---

# Broadcasting

- *Broadcasting* involves sending messages to and from *Sprites*
- Can help when creating interactions between different *Sprites*
- Last week we changed the *Penguin Jokes* project to use *Broadcasting*
- We could also use *broadcast and wait* blocks instead

---

# Custom Blocks

- In Scratch you can create your own *Custom Blocks*
- Useful when you are using similar stacks of blocks in different places
- Combine that stack of blocks into one *Custom Block*
- We looked at an example with a *jump* block, let's look at another

---

# Switch Backdrop

- The *switch backdrop* block is available in the *Looks* section (for *Sprites* and in the *Stage*)
- There is also a *when backdrop switches to* block in the *Events* section
- Can be useful when creating Stories with multiple scenes and characters disappearing
- Will show an example of a Scratch project that uses this block
