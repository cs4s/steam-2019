# Assessing Coding

## Coding & STEAM 2019

### Mr Daniel Hickmott & Dr Elena Prieto-Rodriguez

#### Week 2: Teaching Coding with Scratch

##### 8th August 2019

---

## Assessing Coding

- *Unplugged*
- *Multiple Choice Quizzes*
- *Debug Its*
- *Dr Scratch*

---

## Unplugged

- Tasks and worksheets for students to complete outside of Scratch
- Examples from Scratch website: [Scratch worksheets](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/resources/22-scratch-worksheets)
- We will look at some more examples (some not related to Scratch) as we move through the program

---

## Unplugged: Bebras 365

- *Bebras* (the Lithuanian word for Beaver)
- A bi-annual challenge for students from Years 3 - 12
- You can sign up your class and take part in the challenges 
- Past challenges and questions are available (without an account) on [Bebras 365](https://www.bebras.edu.au/bebras365/)

---

## Multiple Choice Quizzes

- Multiple Choice Quizzes (MCQs) are commonly used for assessing *Computational Concepts*
- Could use platforms like Kahoot! or similar Quiz websites

---

## MCQs: Project Quantum

- **Project Quantum**: A large question bank
	- Not just *Coding* and *Computational Thinking*
	- general *Digital Literacy* as well
- Involves registering a [Diagnostics Questions](https://diagnosticquestions.com/Quantum) account
- [Computing at School](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/) is one of the main contributors

--- 

## Debug Its

- *Scratch programs* that are not working correctly
- Students try and find the cause of the problem and fix them (*debugging*)
- There are Studios of *Debug It* problems online:
	- [Creative Computing Unit 1 (Exploring) Debug It! Studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/475483/) 

---

## Dr Scratch

- [Online tool](http://www.drscratch.org/) for automatic assessment of *Scratch* programs
- Analyses a *Scratch* program and gives mark out of *21*
- Not ideal for measuring students' understanding
- Tool to support reflection and self-evaluation

---

## Assessing Coding

- We have quickly looked at some different approaches for assessing Coding
- In this program you will learn more about these approaches as we progress through the weeks
- We have included links to the different resources, so that you can explore these resources for assessing Coding
