# Managing Classes

---

## Teacher Accounts

- *Teacher Accounts*
- *Creating Class Studios*
- *Remixing Projects*

---

## Teacher Accounts

- We highly recommend getting a *Teacher Account* for managing your classes
- These are a special type of accounts that you have to request through the Scratch website that can help save your time
- The {Stream_Materials} materials were written before *Teacher Accounts* were made available
- We will demonstrate how the {Stream_Materials} activities can be used with *Teacher Accounts*

---

## Teacher Accounts

- In this activity, you will learn about some important *Teacher Accounts* concepts:
	- *Student Accounts*
	- *Classes* & *Class Studios*
	- *Remixing Projects*
- Steps are also in the **Managing Classes with Scratch Teacher Accounts** activity on the website

---

## Concepts: Student Accounts

- a *Student Account* belongs to one *Class*
- Also don't need an email address to create them
- View students' activity and shared projects
- Reset their passwords

---

## Concepts: Classes

- A collection of *Student Accounts*
- Cannot add existing Scratch accounts to a *Class*
- May have to share *Teacher Accounts* (e.g. with an ICT teacher)
- How do you use these (if you use them already)?

---

## Adding a New Class

- Please log into your *Teacher Account*
- *My Classes*: See all the Classes that you have created
- Click *+ New Class* button to create a new *Class*
- Be careful with naming Classes (for privacy reasons)

---

## Adding Students to a Class

- 3 main ways to do this:
	- Adding Students with the *+ New Student* button
	- Creating a Student *Sign-up Link*
	- Adding Students with *CSV Upload*

---

## New Student Button

- In the *Students* tab, click the *+ New Student* button
- Try and add a common name as a Student (such as Bob)
- We often use a combination of a colour, animal, number and a suffix (e.g. CS4S)
	- end up with names like: BlueDog2_CS4S

---

## New Student Button - Sign in as Student

- Open a different web browser and go to [scratch.mit.edu](scratch.mit.edu)
- Log in with the new student account you created
- The password will be your *Teacher Account's* username (e.g. my *Teacher Account* name is *hckm*)
- Good for creating a smaller number of students, may not be ideal for 20+ students

---

## Student Sign-up Link

- You create a *Sign-up Link* for your *Class*
- You could email this out to students or give students the link
- Student chooses the username and password when they sign in

---

## CSV Upload

- Create lots of students at once with a CSV file
- More instructions in the activity document
- You choose the username and the password
- We use this approach for workshops - as explained in *Extension* activity

---

## Creating Students

- 3 main ways to do this:
	- Adding Students with the *+ New Student* button
	- Creating a Student *Sign-up Link*
	- Adding Students with *CSV Upload*
- Each approach has their advantages and disadvantages

---

## Concept: Class Studios

- Studios are a collection of *Projects*
- Really good for sharing *Projects*
- Can also be used for assessment tasks

---

## Concept: Class Studios

---

## Create a Class Studio

- We will now create a *Studio*
- Let's call it *Interesting Projects*
- Can add your own and others projects to *Studios*
- Projects have to be *shared* to be added to a *Studio*

---

## Add a Project to a Studio

- 2 main ways:
	1. From the *Studio* page, with the *Add projects* button
	2. From a project's page, with the *Studios* button
- Let's find an interesting project through *Explore* and add it to the *Studio*

---

## View Students' Activity

- When using a *Teacher Account* you can see when each of your students:
	- shares a project
	- comments on a project
	- loves a project
	- favourites a project

---

## All Class Alerts

You can also see alerts for some activity (account deletion and reporting)

![inline](https://cs4s.github.io/2018/common/presentations/teacher_accounts/alerts.png)

---

## Changing Students' Passwords

1. *Prompt Student*: 
	- changes password to your Teacher Account's username (e.g. *hckm*)
	- student logs in with that password and is then asked to change it
2. *Manually Change*: 
	- you choose the password for the student's account
	- student logs in with that password

---

## Deleting Student Accounts

- Currently only 1 option: log in as the student & request to delete the account
- Also able to *End Classes*
	- projects and studios from the *Class* are still available
	- students can not log in to their accounts while the class is ended

---

# Remixing Projects

---

## What is Remixing?

- Taking a copy of an existing project's blocks and sprites
- You can then make the project "your own"
- Some potential issues (e.g. plagiarism)
- We will do more *Remixing* in later sessions

---

## The Remix Tree

- Available on every **shared** Scratch project
- Shows: 
	- the number of times a project has been remixed
	- the project that has been copied
- Some teachers encourage students remixing projects and then changing %10 or so

---

## Remixing + Teacher Accounts

- Combine with *Studios* to organise students' projects or set tasks
- We will work through an example with a "Debug It!"
- Activity is also on the Week 2 page: *Remixing Projects with Scratch Teacher Accounts* activity
- Link to the "Debug It!" is on Week 2 page: [Creative Computing Unit 1: Debug It! Studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/475483/projects/)

---

## Remixing with Teacher Accounts

1. Create a *Class Studio* for the Task
2. Create a *Project* or remix one
3. Share the *Project*
4. Add it to the *Class Studio*

---

## Remixing as a Student

1. Go to the *Class*
2. Find the *Class Studio* for the "Debug It!"
3. Remix the "Debug It!" *Project*
4. Share the remixed copy
5. Add that remixed *Project* to the *Class Studio*

---

## Teacher Accounts + Remixing

- I plan to use the *Teacher Accounts* and *Remixing* in the coming weeks' sessions
- For the activities, we would like you to use the account details I sent you
- *Teacher Accounts* are a relatively new feature and there could be some changes to how they work
- [Teacher Account FAQ](https://scratch.mit.edu/educators/faq) is very useful
