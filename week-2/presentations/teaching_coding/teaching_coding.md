## Teaching Coding

- *Unplugged*
- *Puzzles*
- *Design Projects*

---

## Unplugged

- Teaching *Coding* without the use of a Computer
- Useful when:
	- introducing and reinforcing different *Computational Concepts*
	- you can't book a Computer lab
	- there are issues with Computers (e.g. no internet)
	

---

## Unplugged - Example

- There are many different *unplugged* activities that cover different *Computational Concepts*
- Code.org has a collection of *unplugged* resources [here](https://code.org/curriculum/unplugged)
- An example we like is [My Robotic Friends](https://curriculum.code.org/csf-1718/courseb/6/#programming-unplugged-my-robotic-friends)
- Could be used to introduce *sequences* before teaching this concept in Scratch

---

## Puzzles

- A common approach for teaching Coding, using Code to solve logic problems
- Navigating a character by giving it instructions are often used as *Puzzles*
- [Lightbot is one example of this](http://lightbot.com/flash.html)

---

## Puzzles - Example

- Code.org (who started the Hour of Code) have many different puzzles
	- [https://code.org/learn](https://code.org/learn)
- Different themes and characters: *Minecraft*, *Frozen* and *Star Wars*
- We will quickly look at the [Frozen Hour of Code activity](https://studio.code.org/s/frozen/stage/1/puzzle/1)

---

## Projects

- Common when teaching Scratch
- These vary in student direction 
	- Could be step-by-step
	- For more confident learners, could provide less guidance
- In this program we will start with step-by-step projects and then move onto more open-ended activities

---

## Projects - Examples

- Wide walls in Scratch: *Stories*, *Animations* and *Games*
- [Code Club](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/scratch/) has some step-by-step guides to creating projects 
- ACARA also has work samples for Digital Technologies, that demonstrate the [planning and creating of Scratch projects](https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/Search/?q=technologies&p=42605&t=ResourcePortfolio&y=42663&s=42692)

## Coding in Stage 3

- In this program we will investigate a combination of these three teaching approaches:
	- *Unplugged*
	- *Puzzles*
	- *Projects*
- We will focus on *Projects* in Scratch
- In this session you will learn about using *Teacher Accounts* to manage students' projects
