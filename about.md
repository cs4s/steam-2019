## About the Program

The *Coding & STEAM* program is a professional learning program for primary school teachers that has been developed by researchers at the University of Newcastle, Australia. 
The program was first run in 2018 as a 10-week program, as part of the *Coding in Stage 3* project.
The *Coding in Stage 3* project was run as part of [Mr Daniel Hickmott's](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/profile/daniel-hickmott-uon){: target="_blank" } PhD research study, which was focussed on understanding how Stage 3 teachers in New South Wales learn and teach Coding and Computational Thinking. 
In 2019, the *Coding & STEAM* program was changed to run for 8 weeks instead of 10 weeks and the activities were updated for Scratch 3.0.

The *Coding & STEAM* program uses resources that have been adapted from activities within the [Creative Computing Curriculum Guide](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/){: target="_blank" }, which was created by researchers at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. 
The main aim of the *Coding & STEAM* program is to demonstrate how the teaching of Coding and Computational Thinking can be integrated into a variety of Key Learning Areas, [as is encouraged by the NSW Education Standards Authority](http://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/learning-areas/technologies/coding-across-the-curriculum){: target="_blank" }.
All of the sessions' activities in the program have been mapped to the relevant Stage 3 syllabus outcomes, AITSL Teacher Standards, ACARA General Capabilities and ACARA Digital Technologies content descriptors, where possible.

## About the Website

The purpose of this website is to assist in the running of the weekly, face-to-face tutorial sessions during the *Coding & STEAM* program, by giving participating teachers one place to find all of the program resources and a record of how the different activities in the program address relevant learning outcomes.
