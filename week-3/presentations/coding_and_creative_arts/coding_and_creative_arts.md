# Coding and the Creative Arts

- Coding is often seen as something mainly technical and not creative
- Who do you think of when you think of something that Codes as part of their job?
- You may think of people like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates or [stereotypes from movies and tv](https://www.google.com/search?q=hackerman&tbm=isch)

# Coders & the Creative Arts

- [Made with Code](https://www.madewithcode.com/mentors/) has an example of Coders that do work in a variety of creative industries, including:
    - Films
    - Video Games
    - Fashion
- One example is [Danielle Feinberg](https://www.pixarpost.com/2014/06/danielle-feinbergs-made-with-code.html) from Pixar

# Using Scratch to be Creative

- Coding in Scratch can be used to make:
    - [Music](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/2823884/)
    - [Art](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/2823884/)
    - [Animations](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/2823884/)

# Creative Computing: Unit 2

- Unit 2 is called **Animations**
- Focus is on *Creative Diversity*
- *Music:* you will compose songs
- *Visual Arts:* you will create images
- *Drama:* You will write scripts for characters (Sprites) to act out

# Creative Computing: Unit 2

*"Itâ€™s really great to express yourself creatively. You could  do  anything  with  it [Scratch]. You can make video games, music, art, videos, anything. The possibilities are endless, no limitations, really."* - Lindsey, 12 years old

# Creative Arts Part 1:

- Three activities from the Guide:
    - *Performing Scripts*
    - *Build-a-Band*
    - *Orange Square, Purple Circle*
- Computational Concepts: *Sequences*, *Loops*, *Events* and *Parallelism*

--- 

# Performing Scripts

- *Coding* in Scratch is like directing theatre. 
- We have characters (*Sprites*), *Costumes*, *Backdrops*, *Scripts* and a *Stage*
- We have *Events* that trigger certain actions (like the green flag)
- We direct the Sprites to move around the *Stage* with the Code blocks

---

# Performing Scripts Activity

- You have a handout with a Script for a scene for two Characters to follow
- Can you create Code in Scratch to act out this script after the green flag is clicked?
- Do you need to "reset" the scene and how do you do this?
- What is *Parallelism*?

---

# Performing Scripts Discussion

- What *Event* blocks did you use in your program?
- How did you "reset" the scene?
- Did anyone use *Broadcasting* for directing the Sprites?

---

# Build-a-Band Activity

- [Build-a-Band Studio](http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/475523)
- Where is the *play note* block?
- Create some different Sprites for different musical instruments
- Add some interaction, when the instruments are clicked they should play some music

---

# Build-a-Band Discussion

- What *Event* and *Sound* blocks did you use in your project?
- Did you change the tempo - what did that do?
- Did you record any sounds for your instruments, how did you do this?
- Did you use *Parallelism* in your projects?

---

# Orange Square, Purple Circle Activity

- [Orange Square, Purple Circle Studio](http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/47552)
- Let's look at the Paint Editor first
- Create two *Sprites*: an Orange Square and a Purple Circle
- Explore some of the *Looks* and *Motion* blocks and see what they do

---

# Orange Square, Purple Circle Discussion

- What *Looks* and *Motion* blocks did you use in your project?
- Let's share the project and add the project to a *Class Studio*
- Did you add another shape? How did you do this?
- Did you find out about the difference between *Bitmap* and *Vector* images?
