# Week 4: Coding and the Creative Arts Part 2

## About

In the Coding and the Creative Arts sessions, you will learn about how the teaching of Coding can be linked to the outcomes in **Creative Arts**, including *Visual Arts*, *Music* and *Drama*.

This session's activities have been adapted from *Unit 2 (Animations)* of the *Creative Computing Curriculum guide*. 
The “big idea” behind Unit 2 is the encouragement of "creative diversity" when teaching students Coding with Scratch.
The activities that you will participate in today involve the creating of scripts for characters in Scratch to act out, composing and playing digital music, creating images and combining these creations together.

In the Part 2 session, we will focus on three activities from Unit 2 of the Creative Computing Curriculum guide: *It’s Alive*, *Debug It!* and *Music Video*. You will also learn about some other resources for the teaching of Coding with the Creative Arts.

####  Numeracy

| Numeracy Element                                         | How this Element is addressed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|:---------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Estimating and calculating with whole numbers            | In this session's activities, you will calculate with whole numbers when creating programs in Scratch. For example, when creating music in the *Music Video* activity, you will use the "play sound" blocks with the number of beats that the sound should be played for.                                                                                            |
| Recognising and using patterns and relationships         | In this session's activities, you will have the opportunity to recognise and use patterns when creating programs in Scratch. For example, when you choose a note to play in the "play note" block, you may recognise that there is a relationship between the note number and the pitch. The larger the note number, the higher pitch the note played is. |
| Using fractions, decimals, percentages, ratios and rates | In the session's activities, you will have the opportunity to use fractions, decimals, percentages, ratios and rates. For example, in the *It’s Alive* activity, you could use blocks in Scratch to make animations that shrink Sprites by a percentage.                                                                                                   |
| Using spatial reasoning                                  | In this session's activity, you will use spatial reasoning when moving Sprites around the canvas in Scratch. For example, in the *Music Video* activity, you may move one of the characters to different positions on the canvas.                                                                                                                           |

| Creating with ICT                                                  | In this session, you will create and modify digital solutions (which will be Scratch projects).                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Communicating with ICT                                             | In this session, you will be introduced to the idea of a "gallery walk", in which you share your created Scratch programs with other participants.                                                                                                                                              |
| Managing and Operating ICT                                         | In this session, you will learn how to use the image editor in Scratch and how this can be used to create bitmap and vector images.                                                                                                                                                             |

| Generating ideas, possibilities and actions         | In this session, you will be encouraged to be creative in the activities and to explore a variety of ideas, possibilities and actions when creating your Scratch projects.                                                                                                                                     |
| Reflecting on thinking and processes                | In this session, you will be encouraged to reflect on how you completed the activity through the reflection prompts from the Creative Computing Curriculum guide. You will also reflect on how a Scratch program requires specific instructions to “reset”, which you will have to create with Scratch blocks. |

| **ACTDIP018:** Design a user interface for a digital system                                                                      | In the session’s activity you will create programs in Scratch that respond to user input. For example, in the *Music Video* activity you will include different musical instruments that can be interacted with. |
| **ACTDIP019:** Design, modify and follow simple algorithms involving sequences of steps, branching, and iteration (repetition)   | In this session’s activities, you will design, modify and follow algorithms (steps of instructions for a computer to follow).                                                                                  |
| **ACTDIP020:** Implement digital solutions as simple visual programs involving branching, iteration (repetition), and user input | In this session, you will implement a program in Scratch, a visual programming language, that includes loops (iteration), events and user input.                                                               |
