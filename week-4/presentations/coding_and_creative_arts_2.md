# Creative Computing: Unit 2

- Unit 2 is called **Animations**
- Focus is on *Creative Diversity*
- *Music:* you will compose songs
- *Visual Arts:* you will create images
- *Drama:* You will write scripts for characters (Sprites) to act out

---

# Creative Arts Part 2:

- Three more activities from Unit 2 of the Guide:
    - *It's Alive!*
    - *Debug It!*
    - *Music Video*
- Computational Concepts: *Sequences*, *Loops*, *Events* and *Parallelism*

--- 

# It's Alive!

- An activity where you animate a character (*Sprite*) in Scratch
- There is a [studio with example Animation projects](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/475529/)
- Link to Studio is on webpage as well:
    - *Links > Animations Activity - Scratch Studio*
- The *It's Alive!* activity demonstrates the difference between *Sprites* and *Costumes*

---

# Flipbook and Claymation Animation

- Before starting a Scratch project, we will look at some examples of animations
- [Flipbooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVzf9rtgf9Y)
- [Claymation](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1tyG6lrA1GVndDmxeFm7K2SBfjoV328BN)[^1]
- By quickly changing the images, we see the illusion that the images are actually moving

# Making Pico Walk

- Use a *next costume* block with a *when this sprite clicked* block and click Pico over and over

![inline 120%](images/pico_walking.png)

- How can we make the *Sprite* (Pico) walk without clicking on Pico over and over?

---

# It's Alive!

- Choose a *Sprite* and animate it
    - For example, you may create a bird flying across the *Stage*
- If you finish early, add some more animated Characters to your scene
- When you finish, share the project and add it to the *STEAM Animations Showcase* Class Studio

---

# It's Alive! Discussion

- What is the difference between a *Sprite* and a *Costume*?
- Did you add more than one *Sprite* to your project?
- Did anyone add more *Costumes* to your *Sprites?*
- How did you use *Sequences*, *Loops* and *Parallelism* in your project?

---

# Unit 2: Debug It!

- Each Unit of the Creative Computing Curriculum Guide has a Studio of Debug It! activities
- I have set up *Class Studios* for each the Unit 2 Debug It activities for you to *Remix*
- *Class Studios*: **STEAM 2019 Debug - 2.1**,**2.2**,**2.3**,**2.4**,**2.5**
- I will show you some example solutions soon
- Once you solve the activity, you can *share* it and add it back to the *Studio*

---

# Unit 2: Debug It! Solutions

- I will show you some solutions to the Unit 2 Debug It! activities
- These won't be the only way to solve them
- You may have done something different - that is OK

--- 

# Music Video

- This activity is more open-ended than the previous activities
- I will show you how to play songs in Scratch
- Students could record their own songs or find songs to add
- Copyright and giving credit to authors of songs/images could be a discussion point for this activity

--- 

# Music Video Discussion

- How did you give credit for ideas, music, or code that you borrowed to use in your project?
- Did you have more than *Sprite* in your project?
- Did you remix an existing project to create your Music Video?
- What are the different *Events* you used? (clicking the green flag? clicking on the *Sprites*?)
