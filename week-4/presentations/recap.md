# Teacher Accounts + Remixing

- The original Creative Computing materials were written before *Teacher Accounts* were made available
- We will use *Remixing* for the Debug It! activities today
- I will demonstrate how you can set up your own *Class Studios*
- I will also demonstrate how *Class Studios* can be used to share projects as well

# Unit 1's Big Idea

*"...educators sometimes worry that they don’t 'know' enough about Scratch to be able to help others. We encourage you to take a broad view of what it means to 'know' Scratch. You don’t need to know everything about the Scratch interface or how to solve every problem that a learner encounters. But, ...educators can serve as cognitive guides, asking questions and helping break down problems into manageable pieces."*

# Unit 2: Animations

- Unit 2 is called **Animations**
- Focus is on *Creative Diversity*
- *Music:* you will compose songs
- *Visual Arts:* you will create images
- *Drama:* You will write scripts for characters (Sprites) to act out

---

    - *Performing Scripts*
