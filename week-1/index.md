# Week 1: An Introduction to Scratch

## About

In this session, we will give an overview of the *Coding & STEAM 2019* program.
We will also ask you to complete a short survey before beginning the session's activities.

In this sessionâ€™s activities, you will find out what *Coding* and *Computational Thinking* are and how these fit into the new [Science and Technology K-6 syllabus](https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/learning-areas/science/science-and-technology-k-6-new-syllabus){:target="_blank"}.  You will learn about *Scratch*, the free *Coding* language and community that is commonly used when teaching *Computational Thinking* in K-6. You will also learn about some of the essential **computational concepts**: *sequences*, *loops* and *events*.

## Key Terms
