# Program Context and Research

- Global push to bring Coding into K-12
- In K-6 NSW: the Digital Technologies strand of the Science and Technology includes Coding
- This project investigates how Stage 3 teachers learn and teach Coding
- The findings could help other educators and researchers improve PL in this area
