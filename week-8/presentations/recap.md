# Coding and Mathematics

- Last week we started the *Games* unit of the Creative Computing Guide
- Also looked at some ways that *Game Design* can be linked to the teaching of Mathematics
- Coding, the design of games and the teaching of Mathematics have been intertwined since the first educational Coding languages (for example, LOGO)
- What *mathematical concepts* and *computational concepts* were in the Week 7 activities?

# Computational Concepts

- The activities last week involved using some different **Computational Concepts**, such as:
    - *Parallelism*
    - *Conditionals*
    - *Operators*
    - *Data*
