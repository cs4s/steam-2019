# Recap: Unit 4 - Games

- We completed the fourth Unit: **Games**
- New **Computational Concepts:** *Conditionals*, *Operators* and *Data*
- Focus was on the use of Scratch for *Game Design*
- Activities were linked to outcomes in *Mathematics*, particularly *Numbers & Algebra*

---

# Mathematics Part 2:

- Two activities from the Guide:
    - *Debug It!*
    - *Interactions*
- When working through your activities you may have learned about some new blocks
- For example, blocks from the *Sensing* category

# Homework Tasks

- Every week we will ask you to complete Homework
- Contributes towards your NESA accreditation hours (each week is 1 hour, for a total of 10 hours)

# Week 8 Homework: If you get stuck

- Try another Puzzle and see if you can use ideas from that Puzzle to solve the previous one
- Have a look at projects that others have added to the ["STEAM Week 8 Homework Puzzles" Class Studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/5218610/)
- Take a look at projects in the more public ["Interactions" Studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/487213/)
- Send me an email and I will send some notes or a project for you to remix

# Week 8 Homework

- Try to solve all three of the Puzzles
- Identify where you have applied different *Computational Concepts*
- The task also involves completing the [Week 8 Homework Form](https://goo.gl/forms/1oqtEw7rpgih5xQj1)
- **Completing that form will send me an email automatically - don't worry about sending me an email about the task as well**
