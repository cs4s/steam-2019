# Recap: Unit 4 - Games

- We completed the fourth Unit: **Games**
- New **Computational Concepts:** *Conditionals*, *Operators* and *Data*
- Focus was on the use of Scratch for *Game Design*
- Activities were linked to outcomes in *Mathematics*, particularly *Numbers & Algebra*

---

# Mathematics Part 2:

- Two activities from the Guide:
    - *Debug It!*
    - *Interactions*
- When working through your activities you may have learned about some new blocks
- For example, blocks from the *Sensing* category

# Homework Tasks

- Every week we will ask you to complete Homework
- Contributes towards your NESA accreditation hours (each week is 2 hour, for a total of 16 hours)
- The tasks and links to complete this homework will always be available on the session page, under the *Homework* heading

# Week 8 Task: Solve some more Puzzles

- Create a project for each of these Puzzles
- *Puzzle #4:* When the sprite touches something blue, it plays a high note. When the sprite touches something red, it plays a low note.
- *Puzzle #5:* Whenever two sprites collide, one of them says: "Excuse me."
- *Puzzle #6:* Whenever the cat sprite gets near the dog sprite, the dog turns and runs from the cat.

# Week 8 Homework: If you get stuck

- Try another Puzzle and see if you can use ideas from that Puzzle to solve the previous one
- Have a look at projects that others have added to the ["STEAM Week 8 Homework Puzzles" Class Studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/25156336/)
- Take a look at projects in the more public ["Interactions" Studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/487213/)
- Send me an email and I will send some notes or a project for you to remix

---

# Week 8 Homework

- Try to solve all three of the Puzzles
- Identify where you have applied different *Computational Concepts*
- The task also involves completing the [Week 8 Homework Form](https://forms.gle/ZpkQrQ7XAmMjhDJ99)
- **Completing that form will send me an email automatically - don't worry about sending me an email about the task as well**

# Homework & Accreditation

- If you have completed all of the tasks and attended/caught up all of the sessions, I will ask the office staff to process your accreditation hours asap
- I would like to finalise the hours and accreditation by the end of the school holidays (October 11th)
- We will send out certificates around October 11th as well, please let me know if you need the certificate before then
