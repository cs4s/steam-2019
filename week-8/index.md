# Week 8: Coding and Mathematics Part 2

## About

In the Coding and Mathematics sessions, you will learn how the creation of games in Scratch can be linked to the teaching of Mathematics concepts.

The teaching of Mathematics alongside Coding has been an area of great interest since the first educational Coding languages were created in the 1970s.
One of the main approaches for combining the teaching of Mathematics and Coding has involved students designing and Coding their own games.
An example of a project where students learned Mathematics through game design was [Project Headlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asos2_Y3UZc){:target="_blank"}, which ran during the late 1980s and early 1990s in a school in Boston, USA.

The session’s activities have been adapted from Unit 4 (Games) of the Creative Computing Curriculum guide. 
The activities in Unit 4 are intended to encourage students to develop Scratch projects are personally relevant and meaningful to them. 
The authors of the guide argue that this personal relevance and meaning will help students persevere when they encounter challenging problems when Coding in Scratch.

In the Part 2 session, we will focus on two activities from Unit 4 of the Creative Computing Curriculum guide: *Debug It!* and *Interactions*.

| Inquiring – identifying, exploring and organising information and ideas | In this session, you will have the opportunity to inquire about how to solve different problems in different ways. For example, when creating projects in Scratch that solve the puzzles in the *Interactions* activity, you will be able to explore existing solutions that other participants or members of Scratch have already made. |
| Generating ideas, possibilities and actions                             | In this session, you will be encouraged to be creative in the activities and to explore a variety of ideas, possibilities and actions when creating the programs for different puzzles in the *Interactions* activity.                                                                                                                   |
| Reflecting on thinking and processes                                    | In this session, you will be encouraged to reflect on how you completed the activity through the reflection prompts from the Creative Computing Curriculum guide. For example, in the *Interactions* activity there is a question that asks the learner about the strategy that they used for solving the different puzzles.             |
| Analysing, synthesising and evaluating reasoning and procedures         | In this session, you will have the opportunity to analyse, synthesis and evaluate your own reasoning and procedures. For example, in the *Interactions* activity you will be able to plan out different ways of solving the puzzles and then reflect on how this planning helped you create the solution in Scratch.                     |

| **ACTDIP018:** Design a user interface for a digital system                                                                                                  | In this session’s activities, you will have the opportunity to design and develop a user interface for the projects you create that solve the puzzles in the *Interactions* activity.                                                                             |
| **ACTDIP019:** Design, modify and follow simple algorithms involving sequences of steps, branching, and iteration (repetition)                               | In this session’s activities, you will design, modify and follow algorithms (steps of instructions for a computer to follow).                                                                                                                                   |
| **ACTDIP020:** Implement digital solutions as simple visual programs involving branching, iteration (repetition), and user input                             | In this session, you will implement a program in Scratch, a visual programming language, that includes loops (iteration), branching, events and user input.                                                                                                     |
| **ACTDIP022:** Plan, create and communicate ideas and information, including collaboratively online, applying agreed ethical, social and technical protocols | In this session, you will collaborate with other participants in the session to solve the puzzles in Scratch. You will also learn about some of the potential ethical and copyright issues when using images and sounds that have been created by other people. |
