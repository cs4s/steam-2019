# Week 7: Coding and Mathematics Part 1

## About

In the Coding and Mathematics sessions, you will learn how the creation of games in Scratch can be linked to the teaching of Mathematics concepts.

The teaching of Mathematics alongside Coding has been an area of great interest since the first educational Coding languages were created in the 1970s.
One of the approaches for combining the teaching of Mathematics and Coding has involved students designing and Coding their own games.
An example of a project where students learned Mathematics through game design was [Project Headlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asos2_Y3UZc){:target="_blank"}, which ran during the late 1980s and early 1990s in a school in Boston, USA.

The session’s activities have been adapted from Unit 4 (Games) of the Creative Computing Curriculum guide. 
The activities in Unit 4 are intended to encourage students to develop Scratch projects are personally relevant and meaningful to them. 
The authors of the guide argue that this personal relevance and meaning will help students persevere when they encounter challenging problems when Coding in Scratch.

In the Part 1 session, we will focus on four activities from Unit 4 of the Creative Computing Curriculum guide: *Dream Game List*, *Starter Games*, *Score* and *Extensions*.

| Estimating and calculating with whole numbers            | In the session’s activities, you will have the opportunity to calculate with whole numbers when creating games in Scratch. For example, when you work through the *Score* activity and test that it works, you will have to calculate whether the resulting score in your game is correct.                                                                                                                       |
| Recognising and using patterns and relationships         | In the session’s activities, you will have the opportunity to recognise and use patterns and relationships in an authentic context (game design and development). For example, in the *Scrolling* activity the Helicopter Sprites moves downwards by changing the position of the Sprite. This downward movement be used an example of the relationship between movement and the co-ordinates of the Sprite.     |
| Using fractions, decimals, percentages, ratios and rates | In this session’s activities, you will have the opportunity to explore the use of fractions, decimals and percentages when creating the different games. For example, in the *Scrolling* activity you may adjust the size of the Helicopter Sprite using a percentage. In that activity, you will also have the opportunity to explore rates by changing the rate at which the Helicopter Sprite moves downward. |
| Using spatial reasoning                                  | In the session’s activity, you will use spatial reasoning when moving Sprites around the Stage in Scratch. For example, in the *Maze* activity, you will move the character to different positions on the Stage.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Applying social and ethical protocols and practices when using ICT | In this session, you will be given the opportunity to learn about the potential ethical issues that can be encountered when creating games in Scratch. For example, in the *Maze* activity, a student may look for sound effects or images to use for Sprites and may need to learn about copyright issues. |
| Creating with ICT                                                  | In this session, you will design, create and modify games (which will be Scratch projects).                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Inquiring – identifying, exploring and organising information and ideas | In this session, you will create games in Scratch after a process of inquiry. For example, in the *Dream Game List* activity you will explore existing games and identify common elements in the games.                                                                                                              |
| Generating ideas, possibilities and actions                             | In this session, you will be encouraged to be creative in the activities and to explore a variety of ideas, possibilities and actions when creating your games in Scratch.                                                                                                                                         |
| Reflecting on thinking and processes                                    | In this session, you will be encouraged to reflect on how you completed the activity through the reflection prompts from the Creative Computing Curriculum guide. For example, in the *Starter Games* activity there is a question about what you found challenging about designing a game.                          |
| Analysing, synthesising and evaluating reasoning and procedures         | In this session, you will have the opportunity to analyse, synthesis and evaluate your own reasoning and procedures. For example, in the *Maze* activity you will be able to plan out the different parts of the maze that you create and you will be able to reflect on how this planning helped you code the game. |

| **ACTDIP018:** Design a user interface for a digital system                                                                                                  | In this session’s activities, you will have the opportunity to design and develop a user interface for the games you create.                                                                                                                                |
| **ACTDIP019**: Design, modify and follow simple algorithms involving sequences of steps, branching, and iteration (repetition)                               | In this session’s activities, you will design, modify and follow algorithms (steps of instructions for a computer to follow).                                                                                                                               |
| **ACTDIP020:** Implement digital solutions as simple visual programs involving branching, iteration (repetition), and user input                             | In this session, you will implement a program in Scratch, a visual programming language, that includes loops (iteration), branching, events and user input.                                                                                                 |
| **ACTDIP022:** Plan, create and communicate ideas and information, including collaboratively online, applying agreed ethical, social and technical protocols | In this session, you will collaborate with other participants in the session to create a game in Scratch. You will also learn about some of the potential ethical and copyright issues when using images and sounds that have been created by other people. |
